BSA#
========

BSA# is a managed implementation of the [BSA format](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:BSA_File_Format) and provides a .NET 4 library that allows for efficient in-memory reading, writing, and manipulation of Bethesda Archives. BSA# also features a command-line interface to manipulate BSAs, with the possibility of a GUI in the future.

BSA# was created for the [Tale of Two Wastelands](http://taleoftwowastelands.com/) mod project, and currently targets Fallout-format BSAs.
